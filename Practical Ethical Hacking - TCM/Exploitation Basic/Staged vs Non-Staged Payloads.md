**This mean this is a reverse shell payload and you can also change the reverse into bind if we want to try other payload**
```
Example:  //this is all at once payload.
windows/meterpreter_bind_tcp 

Example:  //this is onet at a time payload.
windows/meterpreter/bind/tcp 

```
### Non Staged Payloads
```
Sends exploit shellcode all at once
Larger in size and won't always work
Example:
windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp
```
**THIS MEANS IT WILL SEND ALL AT ONCE**
### Staged Payloads
```
Sends in payload in stages
Can be less stable
Example: 
Windows/meterpreter/reverse/tcp
```
**MEANWHILE: IN THE EXAMPLE THE DASH ARE ONE AT A TIME.**

# NOTE: 
**Try different payload to see what really works for us because not every payload will gonna work **
