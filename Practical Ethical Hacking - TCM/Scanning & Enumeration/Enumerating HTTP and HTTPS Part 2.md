2. additional tips in the file extension you can add what you want to look for. For example the apache run on PHP therefor we will put php if we want to look for txt we include in it. etc - so this is how we wrote in the file extension **php,txt,rar,docx,pdf**. 
	   Note: The more extension it gets the longer it takes. so for now we will just use php extension.
